# Sales Data Analysis
## Introduction
Rossmann Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical chain that has 1115 stores.
Rossmann Pharmaceuticalsâ€™ finance team wants to forecast sales in all their 1115 stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time.
The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.
In this project, we are building an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.
